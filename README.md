Consider the query:
select course_id, semester, year, sec_id, avg(tot_cred)
from takes natural join student
where year = 2009
group by course_id, semester, year, sec_id
having count (ID) >= 2;

Explain why joining section as well in the from clause would not change the result.


If you add the section table to the FROM clause (e.g., FROM takes NATURAL JOIN student NATURAL JOIN section), it wouldn’t change the result because:

No Additional Relevant Data:

The query is only grouping by course_id, semester, year, and sec_id, which are attributes that are already present in the takes table.
The section table likely contains course_id, semester, year, and sec_id to describe sections, but since these attributes are already present in takes, joining section adds no new information relevant to this query.
No Attributes from section Used:

The query doesn’t select any additional attributes that exist in section but not in takes. Therefore, including section doesn’t provide any additional data that would affect the outcome.
Maintains the Same Results:

The natural join with section wouldn’t filter or modify the rows in a way that changes the groups or counts since the join keys (course_id, semester, year, sec_id) are already used for grouping in takes.
Thus, joining section in this case is redundant and has no impact on the results of the query.
